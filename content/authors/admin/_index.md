<span style="color:red"> I will be joining the <a href="https://www.cs.fsu.edu/" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;text-decoration-style: dotted;">Department of Computer Science</a> at <a href="https://www.fsu.edu/" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;text-decoration-style: dotted;">Florida State University</a>(FSU) as a tenure track Assistant Professor in Fall 2024. I am currently looking for self-motivated students to work on interdisciplinary projects in the landscape of <b>*AI for Science*</b>. Please see the opening positions below.
</span>

I am a Ph.D. Candidate in Computer Science both affliated with [The Kahlert School of Computing (SoC)](https://www.cs.utah.edu/) and [Scientific Computing and Imaging Institute (SCI)](https://www.sci.utah.edu/) at [The University of Utah](https://www.utah.edu/). I received my M.S. degree at [University of Pittsburgh](https://www.pitt.edu/) and my B.E. degree at [South China University of Technology(SCUT)](https://www.scut.edu.cn/en/). I also spent time at [Schlumberger-Doll Research](http://media.corporate-ir.net/media_files/irol/97/97513/2017ar/interactive/research-center.html) as robotics research intern and at [Amazon](https://www.amazon.science/) as applied scientist intern working on privacy-preserving learning algorihtms and in-context few-shots learning with pretrained large language/multi-modality models.

My research vision is deeply rooted in <b>*AI for Science*</b> --- by leveraging state-of-the-art learning techniques to facilitate the foundamental and classical studies of scientific priciples from <b>complex, structural, and high-dimensional data</b>. I am advised by [Dr. Shandian Zhe](https://users.cs.utah.edu/~zhe/).

My interests include but not limit to
* <b><u>Probabilistic Learning</u> </b>: Bayesian modeling, Approximate Inference, Uncertainty quantification of deep models
* <b><u>AI for Science</u> </b>: Surrogate Modeling, Operator Learning, Physical-Informed Machine Learning
* <b><u>Multi-Objective Learning</u> </b>: Multi-Task Learning, Multi-Fidelity Learning, Transfer Learning, Meta-Learning
* <b><u>Interactive Machine Learning</u> </b>: Bayesian Optimisation, Active Learning, Multi-Armed Bandits, Reinforcement Learning


<!-- <span style="color:red"> I am on job market right now! I am open for academic and industrial poisitions starting <b>summer/fall/winter</b> 2024. If you are interested in my background, do not hesitate to contact me via <u>shiboli.cs@gmail.com</u></span> -->
